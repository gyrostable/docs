# Gyro guardians

### How can I get involved?

All you have to do to become a Gyro Guardian is show up and dive in! It really is that easy. If you like the vision of Gyroscope and want to play a role in its future, come join the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/2vnqnS7wE6).

Currently, there are three working groups. You can express your interest in joining one of them in Discord or simply suggest creating a new working group. In that case you would have to drive the new project.&#x20;

Join the community & bring in your skills to build a resilient stablecoin for DeFi!

### Moving forward

With time more mature contribution models (e.g. Coordinape) may be explored.&#x20;
