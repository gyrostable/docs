Note:

* This chart shows a best guess of the Community airdrop allocations. The actual outcome depends on how many users choose each option in \[[GIP-1](https://snapshot.org/#/s:gyrodao.eth/proposal/0xbd52d92a6972cd565abb24c79de9f5296258e1dc47374025966e8438c9ac11ce)]. If all users chose Option 1, approximately 6% of the supply would be distributed to the community. If all users chose Option 3, approximately 15% would be distributed to the community (after the vesting periods have ended).
* This chart is assuming 700m SPIN has been distributed by TGE. In the event this doesnâ€™t happen, remaining SPIN will continue to be distributed after TGE, so the resulting chart may look similar. Additionally, other distributions may happen after TGE (e.g., further liquidity mining, airdrops, grants).
* An updated chart will be provided should schedules change substantially.
* The effects of any future allocation of the FTL Labs token reserve are not shown on this chart as they are currently not known. The chart will be updated through time.&#x20;

Starting Sun Mar 04 2029 00:00:00 GMT+0000, the total GYFI supply is set to inflate at 2% per year.&#x20;
