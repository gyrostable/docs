<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/chart (3) (1).svg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### DAO - 65% of the GYFI supply, as follows:

* **DAO Initial Service Providers.** 2.25% to be held by service providers to the DAO (including marketing and trading firms) as per [GIP-3](https://snapshot.box/#/s:gyrodao.eth/proposal/0xf47755bd150414d540c6cb16f4a1e2e43097b72b09ebccc7113be8a128e4e5cc). This is an initial amount and the allocation may be increased as a result of further DAO votes.
* **DAO Initial Airdrop.** Up to x% (will be updated at TGE) to be distributed from the DAO to ecosystem participants through an initial airdrop, assuming that all users choose [GIP-1 Option 3](https://snapshot.box/#/s:gyrodao.eth/proposal/0xbd52d92a6972cd565abb24c79de9f5296258e1dc47374025966e8438c9ac11ce). Fewer users choosing Option 3 will result in a lower overall allocation, with that allocation instead remaining in the DAO Treasury.
* **DAO Gyroscope Foundation.** 15% to be held by the Gyroscope Foundation to support the ecosystem.
* **DAO Treasury.** At most 47.75% to be allocated to the DAO Treasury (will be reduced by airdrop amount).&#x20;

**FTL Labs - 35% of the GYFI supply, as follows:**

* **FTL Investors.** 4.47% allocated to investors. All investors are subject to a cliff until the end of October 2025 with linear vesting taking place over 2 years until 31 May 2027.
* **FTL Labs.** 30.53% allocated to FTL Labs, the development company that built the first version of the protocol. All team members are subject to a cliff until the end of October 2025 and 4 year non-linear backweighted vesting typically starting from date of joining FTL Labs. Team members with the largest allocations have agreed to additional lockup terms to prevent a large spike in liquid tokens.
