## The basics

GYFI can be staked in the Gyroscope governance system for voting power. Other voting power sources exist, consult [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") for further information.

The total GYFI supply is 13,700,000.&#x20;

This is currently set to increase at a rate of 2% per year, starting 4 March 2029.

As per a community [vote](https://snapshot.box/#/s:gyrodao.eth/proposal/QmeMYwoCCEhSk8E7BNshU2XeSD91RVdLrkkv3mSV2EApTe), 65% of the GYFI token supply is allocated to the community and 35% to FTL Labs (the initial Gyroscope development company).&#x20;

## Initial airdrop

For eligible recipients, the amount of GYFI initially liquid at TGE depends on how many users choose each [GIP-1](https://snapshot.box/#/s:gyrodao.eth/proposal/0xbd52d92a6972cd565abb24c79de9f5296258e1dc47374025966e8438c9ac11ce) boosted lockup option. The options are:

1. **Option 1**: fully-liquid GYFI tokens. Any user will be able to convert their SPIN to GYFI at a rate of 1,066 SPIN per GYFI. A table of APRs implied by different FDVs is provided below for reference. There will be no vesting of tokens up to a cap. The cap is set high so that it only affects the very largest SPIN holders. This is standard in most projects.
2. **Option 2**: lock up GYFI for 9 months and receive 40% more GYFI than Option 1. The locked tokens will start to unlock immediately over the course of 9 months linearly.
3. **Option 3**: lock up GYFI for 18 months and get 150% more GYFI than Option 1. There will be a 9 month cliff, so that users receive no liquid tokens before month 9 and then tokens linearly unlock from month 10 onwards.

Allocations above 10k GYFI are subject to an additional 6-months linear vesting (but only for the portion above 10k GYFI).

Disclaimer: this documentation primarily summarizes decisions that have been taken by the Gyroscope DAO on the [Gyroscope snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/s:gyrodao.eth). For further information please refer to the original sources.

The initial airdrop is based on a SPIN snapshot taken on 14 March 2025. SPIN points will still accrue and will be convertible to GYFI at the same amount per SPIN in a subsequent distribution. SPIN rates per pool may adapt with the market with any changes made clear in the UI.

Special note for multisig wallets: airdrop claims are on Base. You will need the multisig to be set up on Base to claim. For most Safes, it is possible to create a Safe with the same address on Base. If you are not able to do this with your Safe, reach out in Discord and the team can assist in a custom way.
