# GYFI Tokenomics

The GYFI governance token is deployed on Ethereum [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0x70c4430f9d98b4184a4ef3e44ce10c320a8b7383). GYFI can be staked in the Gyroscope governance system for voting power. Other voting power sources exist, consult [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") for further information.

The total GYFI supply is 13,700,000. This is currently set to increase at a rate of 2% per year, starting 20 August 2027.

As per a community [vote](https://snapshot.box/#/s:gyrodao.eth/proposal/QmeMYwoCCEhSk8E7BNshU2XeSD91RVdLrkkv3mSV2EApTe), 65% of the GYFI token supply is allocated to the community and 35% to FTL Labs (the initial Gyroscope development company).&#x20;

## Initial airdrop

As per [GIP-2](https://snapshot.box/#/s:gyrodao.eth/proposal/0x54a6037539434ee48c29945d71537648f45aca276c345209a10e82de10a1b69a), GYFI claiming/airdrop must occur before **31 January 2025**.&#x20;

For eligible recipients, the amount of GYFI initially liquid at TGE depends on how many users choose each [GIP-1](https://snapshot.box/#/s:gyrodao.eth/proposal/0xbd52d92a6972cd565abb24c79de9f5296258e1dc47374025966e8438c9ac11ce) boosted lockup option. The options are:

* Option 1: fully-liquid GYFI tokens.
* Option 2: lock up GYFI for 9 months and receive 40% more GYFI than Option 1.
* Option 3: lock up GYFI for 18 months and get 150% more GYFI than Option 1.
