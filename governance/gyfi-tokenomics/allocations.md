#### DAO allocations - 65% of GYFI supply, as follows:

* 15% to be held by the Gyroscope Foundation to support the ecosystem (e.g. for a liquidity bootstrapping pool, Foundation hires)
* 50% allocated to the Gyroscope Community / DAO Treasury. The exact split between the Community / Treasury depends on how many users choose Options 1, 2 or 3 in [GIP-1](https://snapshot.box/#/s:gyrodao.eth/proposal/0xbd52d92a6972cd565abb24c79de9f5296258e1dc47374025966e8438c9ac11ce).

**FTL Labs - 35% of the GYFI supply, as follows:**

* 30.53% allocated to the FTL Labs team, including a reserve for future fundraises and hires. All team members were subject to a 9 month cliff (October 2025) and 4 year non-linear backweighted vesting typically starting from date of joining FTL Labs. Team members with the largest allocations have agreed to additional lockup terms to prevent a large spike in liquid tokens.&#x20;
* 4.5% allocated to investors. All investors subject to a 9 month cliff (October 2025) with linear vesting taking place over 2 years until 31 May 2027.
