# Vote delegation

It is possible to delegate your voting power (some or all of it) to others within the Gyroscope governance system. Voting power can be delegated to any address.&#x20;

Why would you want to do this? Well, like politicians are elected to take care of the day-to-day running of a political system, DAO participants can 'elect' someone else to take decisions for the DAO on their behalf.&#x20;

This means you don't have to get directly involved in every decision taken by the DAO, but instead can be indirectly represented. The major advantage of this is saving time: keeping up with all DAO discussions takes a significant amount of time. Instead, you can delegate your voting power to someone else to vote on your behalf.&#x20;

### DAO Delegates

DAO Delegates are individuals who have been nominated, whether by themselves or by others, to represent others. You can see the current DAO delegates here \[INSERT LINK]. You can choose to delegate your voting power to a delegate who you think will represent your interests best.&#x20;
