# The Founding Member Vault

This is intended to be an early proof-of-personhood vault, in which unique people who contribute to the protocol can have a voice in governance.

## How to claim voting power

To claim voting power, a user must first have [claimed a founding frog](https://test.gyro.finance/claim). Community members that participated in the original Gyroscope Testnet game and validated their personhood in Sybil challenges received this NFT. This NFT represents their position as a founding member of the Gyroscope DAO. **Note that this game has now ended**.

Once the founding frog has been claimed, the next step is to claim voting power. This is done by signing a message that proves ownership of a founding frog. You can do that [**here**](https://gov.gyro.finance/vaults/).

## One frog, how many votes?

Different founding frogs have different vote multipliers. Further information is provided [**here**](https://gyro.finance/blog/introducing-the-founding-member-vault/).

Governance can change the voting power of users by calling `NFTVault.updateMultiplier.`
