# GYD LP Vault

Those who provide GYD to selected secondary market trading pools can also have voting power in the governance system. To participate in governance, LPs stake their LP shares in the relevant voting vault, which is subject to an unstaking period.

## Why?

GYD holders are likely to be heavily impacted by decisions taken by governance. So it makes sense to give them say in how the system is governed.&#x20;

Governance can define a set of vaults for which LPing GYD will result in voting power, as well as define the voting power weights for each of these pools.&#x20;
