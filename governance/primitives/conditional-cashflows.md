### Streamlining Governance

Optimistic Approval can be used to streamline current token DAO governance processes by allowing token holders to delegate certain governing powers to a given governing body, who can directly make governing decisions, but subject to veto powers by a guardian. This guardian could be certain community members or, more generally, token holders themselves. The effect is that token DAO participants may not need to participate in day-to-day governance and only need to be available to veto malicious proposals during the timelock period.
