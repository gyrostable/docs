# Overview

The Gyroscope protocol is governed on the Ethereum mainnet blockchain by its users.&#x20;

This governance system governs the future of the Gyroscope protocol and is designed to be fundamentally decentralised.&#x20;

Since the system is on Ethereum mainnet, it's permissionless: anyone can get involved.&#x20;

This documentation will help you get started!

## Who governs?

Various stakeholders in the Gyroscope community control the system:

* holders of the Gyroscope protocol's native governance token, [GYFI](how-it-works/voting-vaults/gyfi-vault.md);
* holders of the Gyroscope stablecoin who [provide it as trading liquidity](how-it-works/voting-vaults/gyd-lp-vault.md);
* [Founding Members](how-it-works/voting-vaults/the-founding-member-vault.md) of the protocol, community members who have been involved since the beginning;
* [Councillors](how-it-works/voting-vaults/councillor-vault.md), parties with expertise in DeFi protocol management;
* other [DAOs](how-it-works/voting-vaults/associated-dao-vault.md).

Votes can also be delegated.

## How governance happens

Participants in the governance system make [proposals](how-it-works/on-chain-proposals.md), which are discussed in the [forum](https://forum.gyro.finance/) and voted on.&#x20;

Some changes need more voters (higher quorum) and of the voters, a higher proportion of agreement in order to pass. This is because some governance actions are low-risk and routine, such as deciding on the recipient of a community grant, while others are high-impact and may implement changes to the entire protocol. See [action tiering](how-it-works/action-tiering.md) to learn more about this.

Proposed changes are subject to a timelock - a waiting period - before they are implemented. This is a protective measure to ensure that protocol participants have time to react to any changes they don't agree with.&#x20;
