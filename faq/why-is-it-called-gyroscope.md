# Why is it called Gyroscope?

[Gyroscope](http://gyro.finance/) is a new stablecoin design that, like a physical gyroscope, remains stable as the surrounding environment changes. Its reserve of capital acts like a spinning disk, maintaining its peg target.

For a demonstration on how a (physical) Gyroscope keeps itself stable in various environments [see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9zhP9Bnx-k).

Gyroscope experiences “friction” if assets in the reserve lose value and users swap stablecoins for the underlying reserve assets. Drawing on the reserves makes the stablecoin “wobbly” as the spinning disk slows, similar to a physical gyroscope. But crucially, also like a physical gyroscope, it can be “spun” back up, with high reserve yields and inflows to the stablecoin boosting the reserve.
