# LP share pricing

To price LP tokens, it is not enough to simply add the values of all assets in the pool as this is easily manipulated. We use a more robust procedure for calculating Balancer LP token values.

Pricing of different types of LP shares are described in the following pages (and in the technical paper available [here](https://github.com/gyrostable/technical-papers/blob/main/Consolidated%20Price%20Feed%20and%20Circuit%20Breakers/Design%20of%20the%20Consolidated%20Price%20Feed%20and%20Circuit%20Breaker%20System.pdf)).
