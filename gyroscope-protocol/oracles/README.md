# Oracles & price feeds

### Overview

Gyroscope uses a system of oracle guardrails to extend the scope of trust minimization and failure tolerance. These include fundamentally designed on-chain consistency checks and circuit breakers, as well as manipulation resistant methods for pricing LP and vault shares.

The following oracles are currently being used by Gyroscope:&#x20;

* Consolidated Price Feed (CPF)
* Balancer Pool LP token (BPT)
